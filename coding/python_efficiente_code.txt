Beautiful is better than ugly
Explicit is better than implicit
Simples is better than complex
Complex is better than complicated
Flat is better than nested
Sparse is better than dense
Readability COUNTS.

Special cases aren't special enought to
BREAK the rules.

Although praticality beats purity

Errors should never pass silently
Unless explicitly sileced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
