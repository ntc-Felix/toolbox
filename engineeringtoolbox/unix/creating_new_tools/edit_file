nano:

    If you type nano filename, it will open filename for editing 
    (or create it if it doesn't already exist). You can move around with 
    the arrow keys, delete characters using backspace, and do other operations with control-key combinations:

    Ctrl + K: delete a line.
    Ctrl + U: un-delete a line.
    Ctrl + O: save the file ('O' stands for 'output'). You will also need to press Enter to confirm the filename!
    Ctrl + X: exit the editor.

How can I save commands to re-run later?
    
    But since the commands you type in are just text, 
    you can store them in files for the shell to run over and over again. 
    To start exploring this powerful capability, put the following command 
    in a file called headers.sh

creating function:

    if you run:
        nano dates.sh
    
    you will create a file named "dates.sh" and will be inside this file
    in the shell prompt

    then you can type:
        cut -d, -f 1 seasonal/*.csv

        then Ctl + O to save the file
        press ENTER to confirm file name
        and Ctrl + X to exist the file
    
    here we created a function called "dates.sh" that extracts the dates
    from the files store in the "seasonal" directory, located at the first column
    of the csv files.

    to run the function in bash you need to type:
        bash dates.sh
