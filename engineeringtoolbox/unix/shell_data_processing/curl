What is curl?

    is short for Client for URLs

    is a Unix command line tool

    transfer data to and from a server

    is used to download data from HTTP(s) sites and FTP servers

Checking curl installation:

    type in command line man curl

Curl syntax:

    curl [option flags] [url]

Curl supports HTTP, HTTPS, FTP and SFTP requests.
for a full list of the options available write:

    curl --help

USE CASES:

    A single file is stored at:

    https://websitename.com/datafilename.txt

    To save the filw withs its original name datafilename.txt,
    use the option flag -O (in uppercase)

        curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename.txt

    To rename the file, use the lower case "-o" + the new file name:

        curl -o renameddatafilename.txt https://websitename.com/datafilename.txt
    
    Oftentimes, a server will host multiple data files, with similar filenames:

        https://websitename.com/datafilename001.txt
        https://websitename.com/datafilename002.txt
        https://websitename.com/datafilename003.txt
        https://websitename.com/datafilename004.txt

    Instead of curl each file individually, we can use wildcards (*)
    to download all the files at once.

        curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename*.txt 
    
    Another option is to use Globbing Parser:
    The following will download every file sequentially starting
    with datafilename001.txt and end with the datafilename100.txt

        curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-100].txt

    Increment through the files and download every Nth file
    (e.g.datafilename010.txt,datafilename020.txt, ..., datafilename100.txt)

        curl -O https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-100:10].txt

    Sometimes Internet can time out. To make sure that out download progress
    is not lost, curl has two flags:

    -L redirects the http url if a 300 error code occurs.

    -C Resumes a previous file transfer if it times out before completion

    Putting everything together:

        curl -L -O -C https://websitename.com/datafilename[001-100].txt

    note: All option flags come before the URL
    but the flags order doesn't matter
