cat = 
    look what is inside a txt file, commonly used to 
    large files

less = 
    one page is displayed at a time

head = 
    print the first few lines(10 or less) of a file

man = 
    short term for "manual", it literally show you a manual
    of the command that you right in front of it

tail = 
    the opposite of head (shows LAST 10 lines)

cut = 
    remove sections from each line of files

history =

# CAT example:

    Before you rename or delete files, you may want to 
    have a look at their contents. The simplest way 
    to do this is with cat, which just prints the 
    contents of files onto the screen. 

    Suppose you are at /home/repl/people and wants to see 
    what is inside the file agarwal.txt

    - cat agarwal.txt

# LESS example:

    Suppose you are in the same situation as the previous example.
    But this time you dont want to see the entire content of the
    file. Instead, you want to see it page by page.

    to do that, you just need to type:

    - less agarwal.txt

    Now lets say you want to open 2 files in the same directory
    to do that:

    - less directory/file1.csv directory/file2.csv

    Here you can press:
        SPACEBAR: to page down
        n: to go to the second file
        q: quit
    
- HEAD example:

    If you are in the directory seasonal
    and wants to see the first few lines of the file
    summer.csv, you will type:

    - head seasonal/summer.csv

- HEAD example (just the 5 first lines):

    -head -n 5 seasonal/winter.csv

- ls use cases:

    ls: prints all files in the directory you are

    ls -R -F: all files in the directory that you are and
        in another directories that are inside this directory

- MAN example:

    man head: it will show what the command head does

- TAIL example:

    If you are in the directory seasonal
    and wants to see the LAST few lines of the file
    summer.csv, you will type:

    - tail seasonal/summer.csv

- TAIL example 2: showing the 7 last lines

    - tail -n +7 seasonal/summer.csv

- CUT example:

    which means "select columns 2 through 5 and columns 8,
     using comma as the separator". 
     cut uses -f (meaning "fields") to specify columns and 
     -d (meaning "delimiter") to specify the separator. 
     You need to specify the latter because some files may 
     use spaces, tabs, or colons to separate columns.

    cut -f 2-5, 8 -d , values.csv
