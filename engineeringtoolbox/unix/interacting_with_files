cat = look what is inside a txt file, commonly used to large files

less = one page is displayed at a time



# CAT example:

    Before you rename or delete files, you may want to 
    have a look at their contents. The simplest way 
    to do this is with cat, which just prints the 
    contents of files onto the screen. 

    Suppose you are at /home/repl/people and wants to see 
    what is inside the file agarwal.txt

    - cat agarwal.txt
