To create a shell variable, you simply assign a value to a name:

    training=seasonal/summer.csv

    note:
        it must be write as it was written in the last example
        variablename=...
        with no spaces between the words

How can I repeat a command many times?

    Shell variables are also used in loops, which repeat commands many times. If we run this command:

        for filetype in gif jpg png; do echo $filetype; done

    it will print:
        gif
        jpg
        png
    
LOOP EXAMPLE:

    if you are in a directory with a lot of csv files and wants to print
    the first rows that contains '2017-07' in each file, you can:

        for file in directory/*.csv; do grep 2017-07 $file | tail -n 1; done
