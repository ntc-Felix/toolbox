# Cp example:
    if you are in the directory home/repl/
    and wants to make a copy of the file 'summer.csv'
    stored in home/repl/seasonal into the paste 
    home/repl/backup, then you have to write:

    - cp seasonal/summer.csv backup/summer.csv

# Cp example 2: Multiple files

    if you are in the directory home/repl/
    and wants to make a copy of the file 'summer.csv'
    AND the file 'spring.csv'
    stored in home/repl/seasonal into the paste 
    home/repl/backup, then you have to write:

    - cp seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv backup

# MV example: moving 2 files

    You are in /home/repl, 
    which has sub-directories seasonal and backup. 
    Using a single command, move spring.csv and 
    summer.csv 
    from seasonal to backup.

    - mv seasonal/spring.csv seasonal/summer.csv backup

# MV example 2 : USING MV TO RENAME FILES

    lets suppose you are in the directory
    /home/repl/seasonal
    and wants to change winter.csv file name to
    winter.csv.bck

    - mv winter.csv winter.csv.bck

# RM example: deleting a file

    you are in /home/repl, and wants to delete a file
    that is in /home/repl/seasonal

    - rm seasonal/filename.txt

# RMDIR example: deleting a directory

    if you are in /home/repl and wants to delete
    the folder seasonal

    - rmdir seasonal

# MKDIR example: creating a new folder

    now you have deleted seasonal, you change your mind
    and wants to create it again

    - mkdir seasonal
